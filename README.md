Project: College Student Placement Prediction
This project analyzes a dataset of college students to predict placement outcomes.
ðŸ”¹ Classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) were used to predict Placement (Yes/No).
ðŸ”¹ Regression models (Linear, Regression Tree) were tested using CGPA as the target, but results showed weak predictive power.
Key steps:
â€¢	Performed EDA (Univariate & Bivariate Analysis)
â€¢	Handled class imbalance using SMOTE
â€¢	Detected & addressed multicollinearity
â€¢	Scaled data and tuned models with GridSearchCV
â€¢	Evaluated using Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score, RÂ², RMSE
âž¡   Focused mainly on classification, as regression results were not meaningful for this dataset.
